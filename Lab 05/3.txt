
Experiment 3: Vector Space Retrieval (Week-4)

Vector space retrieval models represent documents and queries as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In such models, retrieval is based on computing the similarity between document and query vectors. Elasticsearch has incorporated vector features and can be used to build and test a vector space retrieval system. Hereâ€™s an experimental design to test the effectiveness of a vector space retrieval model using Elasticsearch and visualize the results using Kibana:

Objectives:
To understand the efficacy of vector space retrieval in Elasticsearch compared to traditional keyword-based search.
To visualize the retrieval results using Kibana.

3.1 Data Preparation:
Dataset: Use a standard text corpus (e.g., the 20 Newsgroups dataset, Wikipedia dump, etc.).
Pre-processing: Tokenize, stem, and remove stop words from the documents.

3.2 Setup:
Elasticsearch:
Install Elasticsearch.
Create an index with appropriate mappings. For vector fields, you can use the dense_vector type.
Kibana:
Install and set up Kibana to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster.

3.3 Experiment Steps:
Document Vectorization:
Use a pre-trained model (e.g., Word2Vec, FastText, BERT) to generate vectors for each document in your dataset.
Store each document along with its vector in the Elasticsearch index.
Query Processing:
Convert user queries into vectors using the same pre-trained model.
Use the cosine similarity script in Elasticsearch to retrieve the most similar documents based on the query vector.
Traditional Keyword-based Search (for comparison):
Use Elasticsearch's standard text-based search (e.g., BM25) to retrieve documents based on keywords.

3.4 Evaluation:
Relevance Judgements:
Use a set of benchmark queries for which relevance judgements are available or create your own by manually labeling a subset of documents as relevant/irrelevant for specific queries.
Metrics:
Use standard IR metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, Mean Average Precision, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain to evaluate the performance.
Visualization in Kibana:
Use Kibana to visualize the retrieval results. This can include histograms of scores, precision-recall curves, and heatmaps of document similarity.
Compare the results of the vector space retrieval with traditional keyword-based search visually.

3.5 Analysis:
Effectiveness: Compare the effectiveness of vector space retrieval against traditional keyword-based search using the metrics computed.
Efficiency: Analyze the query response time for both methods.
Visualization: Inspect the visual results in Kibana to derive insights about where vector space retrieval excels or falls short compared to traditional methods.

3.6 Conclusion:
Based on the results, draw conclusions about the benefits and limitations of vector space retrieval using Elasticsearch. Offer recommendations for potential improvements or adjustments.
Ensure you have enough computational resources as vector-based operations, especially on large corpora, can be resource-intensive.
The performance might vary based on the choice of pre-trained models, so consider testing multiple vectorization strategies.
While this experiment focuses on the retrieval aspect, real-world applications might also need to consider ranking, clustering, and other post-retrieval processing steps.
